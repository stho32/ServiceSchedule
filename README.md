# Service Schedule

This web app helps you with the creation of a service schedule. 
E.g. your neighbor asks you to watch his or her home while being on holiday. 
While they are away certain tasks have to be performed in different rhythms. This tool will map a calender out telling you what to do when with checkboxes attached, so you can easily check them and perform those tasks without ever thinking about if you did that yesterday? Or did it need do be done today?
